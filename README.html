    <h2> Purpose </h2>
    
    <p> The main focus is to use the dataset provided to assist the company in increasing their customer retention rates. This will be achieved by analyzing and modeling the data, targeting customer 'churn' rate, to potentially predict the current likelihood of a customer terminating their contract. This will allow the company a chance to intervene before the loss of a client. As well as to gain insights into specific features that have higher churn rates, so that the company may implement policy changes to lower the future likelihood of loss. </p>
